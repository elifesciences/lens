                <p>Previous studies suggest that the toxic soluble-oligomeric form of different
                    amyloid proteins share a common backbone conformation, but the amorphous nature
                    of this oligomer prevents its structural characterization by experiment. Based
                    on molecular dynamics simulations we proposed that toxic intermediates of
                    different amyloid proteins adopt a common, nonstandard secondary structure,
                    called &#x3b1;-sheet. Here we report the experimental characterization of
                    peptides designed to be complementary to the &#x3b1;-sheet conformation observed
                    in the simulations. We demonstrate inhibition of aggregation in two different
                    amyloid systems, &#x3b2;-amyloid peptide (A&#x3b2;) and transthyretin, by these
                    designed &#x3b1;-sheet peptides. When immobilized the &#x3b1;-sheet designs
                    preferentially bind species from solutions enriched in the toxic conformer
                    compared with non-aggregated, nontoxic species or mature fibrils. The designs
                    display characteristic spectroscopic signatures distinguishing them from
                    conventional secondary structures, supporting &#x3b1;-sheet as a structure
                    involved in the toxic oligomer stage of amyloid formation and paving the way for
                    novel therapeutics and diagnostics.</p>

                <p>The build up of very thin fibres called amyloid fibrils is known to lead to more
                    than 40 different human diseases, including Parkinson&#x2019;s disease and
                    rheumatoid arthritis. These diseases involve soluble proteins or peptides
                    joining other proteins or peptides to form the fibrils, which are not soluble.
                    However, the damage is done by the time the fibrils form because soluble
                    intermediate structures formed by the proteins and peptides are toxic. The
                    development of methods that can detect these toxic intermediate structures could
                    lead to earlier interventions before significant damage.</p>
                <p>Amyloid fibrils are known to have a beta-sheet structure that is found in many
                    protein systems. In 2004, based on computer simulations, researchers predicted
                    that proteins and peptides that go on to form amyloid fibrils would pass through
                    a related but less stable structure called an alpha-sheet, and that this
                    structure would be toxic. Now Hopping et al., including some of the researchers
                    involved in the 2004 work, have confirmed that the alpha-sheet structure is
                    indeed involved in the formation of amyloid fibrils.</p>
                <p>To do this Hopping et al. designed peptides with alpha-sheet structures that
                    could bind to the alpha-sheet structures predicted by their simulations. When
                    these complementary designed peptides were added to a solution of peptide that
                    causes Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease, or a protein that causes systemic amyloid
                    disease, the designed peptides bound the toxic peptides or proteins and
                    prevented the formation of fibrils.</p>
                <p>The results of Hopping et al. suggest that designed alpha-sheet compounds might
                    be able to capture peptides and proteins that are implicated in a wide variety
                    of amyloid diseases, independent of their composition and native structure, by
                    targeting the intermediate alpha-sheet structure. Future challenges include
                    showing that most proteins and peptides pass through this intermediate structure
                    as they form fibrils, and improving the sensitivity of the binding in the hope
                    of developing diagnostics for amyloid diseases.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>There are now over 40 different human amyloid diseases, each linked to the buildup of
                a specific precursor protein or peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiti and
                    Dobson, 2009</xref>). These diseases involve the conversion of a protein from
                its soluble native state into insoluble amyloid fibrils, or, in the case of
                peptides, the conversion from a soluble, loosely structured form to fibrils. Given
                that many different sequences can form amyloid fibrils of similar architecture,
                there may be some common structural features of the prefibrillar amyloidogenic
                intermediates. X-ray fiber diffraction indicates that the insoluble, mature amyloid
                fibrils are composed of cross &#x3b2;-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib29">Jahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"
                    >Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is widely held that the
                formation of amyloid fibrils involves a transition to &#x3b2;-sheet structure in the
                amyloidogenic intermediate. However, the mechanism of self-assembly at the atomic
                level remains elusive. Another feature of these diseases is that soluble oligomeric
                intermediates, not the insoluble well-ordered fibrils, are preferentially
                responsible for cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bucciantini et
                    al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardy and Selkoe,
                    2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tomic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the soluble
                oligomeric forms of the prion protein are the most infectious per unit protein
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silveira et al., 2005</xref>). As such,
                fibrils may be protective, at least up to a point, as their breakdown to smaller
                aggregates yields greater toxicity and infectivity. The discovery of a compound that
                promotes inclusion formation while reducing toxicity and cellular pathology supports
                this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodner et al., 2006</xref>). In a
                similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al. (2013)</xref>
                demonstrated that binding the fibrillar state of A&#x3b2; could reduce toxicity
                presumably by shifting the equilibrium from oligomer to fibril.</p>
            <p>Research on the soluble oligomers has become critically important since there is a
                consensus that the soluble oligomer species is more toxic than mature fibrils (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib42">Tomic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et
                    al., 2009</xref>) and, while nontoxic, the fibrils are a reservoir for toxic
                oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shahnawaz and Soto,
                    2012</xref>). In fact, structural similarities between soluble oligomers from a
                range of unrelated proteins/peptides has been demonstrated by generation of an
                antibody that recognizes a common backbone structure (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib31">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tomic
                    et al., 2009</xref>). Glabe and co-workers developed an antibody (denoted A11)
                that is specific for soluble oligomeric intermediates derived from a variety of
                peptides and proteins, including A&#x3b2;(1-42), &#x3b1;-synuclein, islet amyloid
                polypeptide, polyglutamine, lysozyme, human insulin, and a prion peptide (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glabe and Kayed, 2006</xref>). The antibody does
                not, however, bind the corresponding insoluble fibrils (cross-&#x3b2; structure) or
                the natively folded precursors (various structures). Based on the specificity of the
                antibody for soluble oligomers with various sequences, it was proposed that the
                antibody might recognize a unique conformation of the backbone. This antibody
                inhibits toxicity associated with the intermediates, implying a common mechanism of
                toxicity and offering hope for a broad-based therapeutic agent.</p>
            <p>Some years ago we &#x2018;discovered&#x2019; a novel secondary structure, which we
                call &#x2018;<italic>&#x3b1;-sheet</italic>&#x2019;, that is populated during
                molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a range of amyloid proteins (and peptides)
                with different structures and sequences under amyloidogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"
                    >Armen et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2004b</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"
                    >Steward et al., 2008</xref>). The position where the &#x3b1;-sheet forms along
                the sequence coincides with the most amyloidogenic regions of the proteins, as
                determined experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armen et al.,
                    2004a</xref>). Consequently, we proposed that &#x3b1;-sheet is a common
                structure involved in the early stages of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib1">Armen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"
                    >Daggett, 2006</xref>). In the course of characterizing the structure observed
                by MD, we learned that &#x3b1;-sheet was first predicted by Pauling and Corey and
                called &#x2018;<italic>polar pleated sheet</italic>&#x2019;. However, they ruled the
                structure energetically unfavorable and concluded, correctly, that the &#x3b2;-sheet
                structure would be favored in normal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36"
                    >Pauling and Corey, 1951</xref>). An &#x3b1;-sheet is similar to a
                &#x3b2;-sheet, but instead of alternating main chain NH and C &#x3d; O groups along
                the strands, an &#x3b1;-sheet has the NH groups aligned on one side and the
                carbonyls on the other. As such, the &#x3b1;-sheet has a molecular dipole and a very
                different hydrogen-bonding pattern across the sheet compared to a &#x3b2;-sheet.
                Interestingly, the main chain (&#x3a6;, &#x3a8;) dihedral angles of the
                &#x3b1;-sheet alternate between the &#x3b1;<sub>L</sub> and &#x3b1;<sub>R</sub>
                conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daggett, 2006</xref>). Although locally helical, the
                alternating dihedral angles form an extended chain resulting in the carbonyl groups
                and amide groups aligning in a plane. Such an arrangement creates uniform
                electrostatic faces to aid in the addition of further strands (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib3">Armen et al., 2004b</xref>). Once a sheet is formed, a simple peptide
                plane flip could convert the &#x3b1;-sheet into a &#x3b2;-sheet and ultimately a
                mature fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daggett, 2006</xref>).
                &#x3b1;-sheet structure has been observed in a peptide crystal structure (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Blasio et al., 1994</xref>), and short stretches
                of &#x3b1;-strand are present in various proteins in the Protein Data Bank (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daggett, 2006</xref>), although extensive
                &#x3b1;-sheet formation has not been observed in native proteins.</p>
            <p>To investigate the role of &#x3b1;-sheet in amyloid formation, we computationally
                designed numerous small, stable &#x3b1;-hairpin peptides. We reasoned that if
                &#x3b1;-sheet is the novel backbone structure in toxic oligomers, then
                &#x3b1;&#x2212;sheet peptides designed to be complementary to the structure in the
                oligomer should bind to the toxic oligomer and inhibit amyloidosis. Our designs
                began with a backbone template in an ideal &#x3b1;-sheet conformation. We then
                investigated combinations of residues with high propensities to populate desired
                regions of conformational space using our Structural Library of Intrinsic Residue
                Propensities (SLIRP), which is part of our Dynameomics project (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib44">van der Kamp et al., 2010</xref>). Owing to the expected transient
                nature of the &#x3b1;<sub>L</sub> conformation, we stabilized the structure using
                D-amino acids, which essentially have inverted conformational propensities compared
                with their normal L-counterparts.
                Peptides containing alternating D- and L-amino acids have previously been shown to
                form extended structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Santis et al.,
                    1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heitz et al., 1981</xref>), and
                they populate similar conformational space as our MD-identified &#x3b1;-sheet
                sequences consisting solely of L-amino acids. MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2000&#x2013;2014</xref>) were performed to assess the
                stability of the de novo designed amino acid sequences. Sequences designed to adopt
                &#x3b2;-sheet and random coil conformations were included in our experiments as
                controls.</p>
            <p>Several of the most promising peptide designs were selected for experimental
                characterization in two different amyloid systems: transthyretin (TTR) and beta
                amyloid 1-42 [A&#x3b2;(1&#x2212;42) or A&#x3b2; for short]. Both are associated with
                amyloid diseases, systemic in the case of TTR and Alzheimer's Disease in the case of
                A&#x3b2;, but they have completely different sequences and structures. A&#x3b2; is a
                largely unstructured peptide fragment in aqueous solution, while TTR is a tetramer
                composed of immunoglobulin-like &#x3b2;-sandwich domains. Both systems have well
                characterized aggregation profiles and aggregate under mild, non-denaturing
                conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quintas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foss et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib28">Hopping et al., 2013</xref>). Here we focus on five peptide designs
                    (<italic>&#x3b2;, rc, &#x3b1;1, &#x3b1;2, &#x3b1;3</italic>). <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> is the
                designed Trpzip 3 &#x3b2;&#x2212;hairpin, but with Trp to Leu substitutions to
                improve spectroscopic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cochran et al.,
                    2001a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">b</xref>). The &#x3b2;-design was
                included as a negative control for TTR and a positive control for A&#x3b2;.
                &#x3b2;-hairpins are known inhibitors of A&#x3b2; aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib47">Yamin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng
                    et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>rc</italic> peptide was designed to be an
                unstructured random coil to provide a negative control; it is a randomly scrambled
                version of the &#x3b2;-sheet sequence, <italic>&#x3b2;</italic>. The remaining three
                peptides were designed to adopt &#x3b1;-sheet structure. <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>
                and <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> are linear hairpins containing a sheet of alternating
                D- and L-amino acids. <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> was designed to have high
                &#x3b1;-sheet propensity. <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> is a derivative of
                    <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> with modifications aimed to improve stability and the
                introduction of a Cys for coupling experiments. <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> consists
                of a sheet of alternating D- and L-amino acids and two turns, creating a cyclic
                amide backbone. Despite our best efforts we were unable to design a soluble, random
                coil control based on the &#x3b1;-sheet peptides, i.e. the same composition and
                length. Shuffling of the amino acid sequences resulted in insoluble peptides that
                were unusable in the solution-phase assays, so we opted to use smaller but
                well-defined controls.</p>

                <p>First we tested our peptides for anti-amyloidogenic activity in a fibrillization
                    assay using transthyretin (TTR). Four of the five designed peptides
                        (<italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> was sparingly soluble and therefore not tested in
                    any solution-phase experiments) were co-incubated with TTR (in excess 20:1,
                    expressed relative to TTR monomer) at pH 4.5 to trigger dissociation of the
                    native tetramer followed by aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"
                        >Quintas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foss et al.,
                        2005</xref>). Note that a 10:1 ratio (and higher) is common in these
                    aggregation inhibition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frydman-Marom
                        et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hochdorffer et al.,
                        2011</xref>). The aggregation was monitored via binding of Congo red. The percentage inhibition of
                    aggregation was determined at 48 hr, after the aggregation stabilized. At these
                    concentrations, <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> resulted
                    in 72 and 56% inhibition, respectively, relative to TTR alone at low pH. In
                    contrast, the <italic>rc</italic> and <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> controls resulted
                    in little to no inhibition. The neutral pH tetrameric TTR control changed little
                    over time. Moreover, the designs in the absence of TTR did not bind Congo red
                    and were indistinguishable from the buffer-only controls. To ensure that the
                    observed increase in Congo red binding reflected the formation of amyloid
                    fibrils, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM).</p>
                <p>Since our aim is to target the toxic oligomer, we determined when the toxic
                    oligomeric species was present during the course of aggregation. The toxicity of
                    TTR was assessed by monitoring cell viability using the MTT assay after treating
                    SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with TTR that had been allowed to aggregate for
                    different periods of time at pH 4.5. Toxicity was apparent around 24 hr, and the
                    results from this time point are shown in Figure
                        2B. Under these conditions, the viability of the treated cells was
                    reduced by approximately 20%, indicating that TTR was aggregating via the toxic
                    pathway. Addition of the controls, <italic>rc</italic> or
                        <italic>&#x3b2;</italic>, to a 24-hr pre-incubated TTR sample had little to
                    no effect on further aggregation, as detected with the Congo red assay. However,
                    when <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> were mixed with
                    24-hr pre-incubated, toxic TTR, they inhibited 81% and 77%, respectively, of the
                    remaining TTR aggregation observed in the absence of inhibitor.</p>
                <p>Similarly, we co-incubated our designs (in 10:1 excess) with A&#x3b2; at pH 7.4
                    and followed fibril formation with thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence changes upon
                    binding). The presence of
                    fibrils was confirmed by AFM spectroscopy. As observed for TTR, both
                        <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> inhibited the levels
                    of fibril formed. Again <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> was more efficient, inhibiting
                    approximately 87% of fibril formation compared with 66% for
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3,</italic> when measured after the reaction stabilized at 22
                    hr. The &#x3b2;-sheet design, <italic>&#x3b2;</italic>, also resulted in 62%
                    inhibition of A&#x3b2; fibrillization, which began exerting its effect primarily
                    between 0 and 6 hr. In contrast, <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> became inhibitory
                    after aggregation proceeded for approximately 6 hr. The peptide designs alone
                    did not alter the fluorescence of ThT, and, as with Congo red, they were
                    indistinguishable from buffer&#x2013;only controls over the time course of the
                    assay. Also note that the &#x3b1;-sheet designs are effective at lower
                    concentrations and the efficacy increases at lower temperature; for example, a
                    fourfold excess of <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> essentially completely abolishes
                    A&#x3b2; aggregation at 25&#xb0;C (unpublished). We report the 37&#xb0;C results
                    here, though, for comparison with TTR, which aggregates more slowly at
                    25&#xb0;C.</p>
                <p>A&#x3b2; toxicity was also assessed using the MTT assay and found to reduce the
                    viability of treated SH-SY5Y cells to less than 50% after 6 hr incubation. Addition of the &#x3b1;-sheet
                    designs to a pre-aggregated (6 hr), toxic sample of A&#x3b2; showed essentially
                    complete inhibition of 97% for <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and 96% for
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic>, compared with the extent of remaining aggregation
                    observed in the absence of inhibitor.</p>

                <title>Immobilization of designs</title>
                <p>Despite much effort over the last few years it has not proved possible to isolate
                    and characterize toxic soluble oligomers. So, to further probe which species our
                    peptide designs are binding to, we immobilized the designs on agarose beads and
                    applied solutions of either fresh or pre-incubated, toxic samples of A&#x3b2;
                    and TTR. Immobilization in this manner also allowed us to test the sparingly
                    soluble <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> design by limiting self-aggregation. The
                    peptides were immobilized via their lysine residues on aldehyde-functionalized
                    agarose beads. Their ability to bind TTR or A&#x3b2; from solutions at various
                    stages of aggregation was investigated using dot blot analysis of the eluents.
                    All three immobilized &#x3b1;-sheet designs (<italic>&#x3b1;1, &#x3b1;</italic>2
                    and <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic>) bound significantly more TTR from pre-incubated,
                    toxic oligomer-containing TTR solutions (pre-incubated at low pH for 24 hr) than
                    did the <italic>rc</italic> and <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> controls. Note that while
                        <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> does not perform as well as the other two designs, the binding of TTR by
                        <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> relative to the <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> and
                        <italic>rc</italic> controls is significant, as shown by the statistical
                    analysis in. The extent of TTR binding by the <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> and
                        <italic>rc</italic> controls is the same as that of the column matrix alone,
                    which does bind some TTR in the absence of immobilized peptide.
                        <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>, <italic>&#x3b1;2</italic> and
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> also bound pre-aggregated, toxic A&#x3b2;
                    preferentially, whereas <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> and <italic>rc</italic> did not
                        . In the case of the <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> design, it
                    preferentially bound the fresh, monomeric A&#x3b2; solutions (0 hr) over the
                    toxic solutions (6 hr),
                    indicating that inhibition was due to interactions with the
                    &#x2018;native&#x2019; form, not the toxic oligomer. &#x3b2;-hairpins are known
                    inhibitors of A&#x3b2; aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamin et
                        al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, &#x3b1;-sheet, as demonstrated with
                        <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>, did not bind native, tetrameric TTR nor fresh,
                    monomeric A&#x3b2; but instead preferentially bound species from the toxic,
                    aggregated 6 hr samples.
                    Moreover, the &#x3b1;-sheet designs did not bind the fibrillar forms of A&#x3b2;
                    or TTR acquired by allowing the aggregation reactions to continue for over 3
                    weeks, as illustrated with immobilized <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>.</p>

                <p>The instability of &#x3b1;-sheet structure in proteins and peptides containing
                    solely L-amino acids leaves us with no established spectroscopic signatures with
                    which to assess our structures. We can, however, make and test predictions based
                    on the unique conformational and electronic environments resulting from this
                    structure. Circular dichroism (CD) signals arise from the differential
                    absorption of left- and right-hand polarized light by chiral molecules. For
                    proteins, the orientation of individual amide bonds is responsible for the
                    resulting CD spectra in the far-UV region. Mirror image structures, formed by
                    replacing whole L-amino acid sequences with D-amino acids, such as gramicidin A,
                    produce mirror-image CD-spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koeppe et
                        al., 1992</xref>). We anticipate that the &#x3b1;-sheet structure would be
                    effectively invisible due to near equal absorbance of both left and right
                    polarized light, with any residual signal emanating from the turns and terminal
                    residues.</p>

                <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can provide site-specific
                    conformational information. Owing to the unique alignment of the amide groups in
                    an &#x3b1;-sheet, we expect to see strong sequential d<sub>NN</sub> Nuclear
                    Overhauser Effect (NOE) crosspeaks along the backbone since the NH groups are
                    aligned on one side of the chain instead of alternating between opposite faces
                    as in &#x3b2;-sheet structure. Furthermore, we would not expect to observe the
                    long-range d<sub>NN</sub> or the strong sequential d<sub>&#x3b1;N</sub> NOEs
                    characteristic of &#x3b2;-sheets. Thus, CD, FTIR and NMR studies were performed
                    to assess the structures of our peptide designs.</p>
                <p>The CD spectrum of <italic>rc</italic> shows a random coil signal with a strong
                    negative absorption around 200 nm. In its FTIR spectrum we observe multiple small absorbance peaks
                    not corresponding to a predominance of any specific structure. Our &#x3b2;-sheet control is a
                    modified version of the Trpzip peptide, which forms a stable &#x3b2;-hairpin in
                    solution. In agreement with previous structural work (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="bib16">Cochran et al., 2001a</xref>), <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> exhibits
                    a CD spectrum reflective of &#x3b2;-structure and random coil, with a minimum
                    near 220 nm and another near 200 nm. The substitution of Leu for Trp removed the strong
                    exciton-coupling between the Trp residues observed in the parent peptide thereby
                    &#x2018;exposing&#x2019; the &#x3b2;-structure CD signal. The &#x3b2;-sheet
                    structure was confirmed by FTIR through its strong absorbance at 1632
                        cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.
                    The CD spectra for <italic>&#x3b1;1, &#x3b1;2</italic> and
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic> are essentially featureless, as expected for the
                    cancellation of &#x3b1;<sub>L</sub> and &#x3b1;<sub>R</sub> signals, except for
                    a slight dip around 200 nm consistent with turn formation. <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and

                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2005</xref>), and suggests
                    an area for improvement in future designs. Altogether, these results prove that
                    the designed &#x3b1;-sheet peptides do not form &#x3b1;-helix or &#x3b2;-sheet
                    structure, and that the random coil content is not large (compare against the
                    scale of the <italic>rc</italic> control CD spectrum). Thus, these results are
                    consistent with and supportive of the designed &#x3b1;-sheet
                            structure.</p>
                <p>We performed further structural studies utilizing homonuclear NMR spectroscopy.

                    soluble enough for NMR). No
                    long-range d<sub>NN</sub> or d<sub>&#x3b1;N</sub> NOEs indicative of
                    &#x3b1;-helical or &#x3b2;-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"
                        >W&#xfc;thrich, 1986</xref>) were observed. The NH&#x22ef;NH NOEs are mapped
                    onto structural models of <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic>, highlighting the stretches of &#x3b1;-strand structure in both
                    designs. As mentioned above, strong sequential d<sub>NN</sub> NOEs are expected
                    for &#x3b1;-sheet, but not for &#x3b2;-sheet, and strong sequential
                        d<sub>&#x3b1;N</sub> NOEs are expected for &#x3b2;-sheet, but not for
                    &#x3b1;-sheet. To test this idea we calculated the ensemble-weighted
                    NH&#x2013;NH, intraresidue H&#x3b1;-NH and sequential H&#x3b1;-NH distances in
                    MD simulations for <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> in an &#x3b1;-sheet conformation
                    and a &#x3b2;-sheet conformation, as well as a natural &#x3b2;-hairpin within a
                    protein). The calculated NH&#x2013;NH distances in the
                    strands are much shorter in the &#x3b1;-sheet, consistent with the strong
                        d<sub>NN</sub> NOEs observed for both <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic>, and the observed breaks in the patterns reveal vulnerabilities in the
                    structures and provide direction for improved designs. The bulk of the observed
                    intraresidue and sequential d<sub>&#x3b1;N</sub> NOE intensities in are of similar magnitude (12/21
                    for <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>) or the intraresidue NOE is stronger (6/21 for
                        <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic>)<italic>,</italic> consistent with &#x3b1;-sheet
                    structure. There are, however, three residues with strong
                    sequential d<sub>&#x3b1;N</sub> NOEs in <italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> but all three
                    of these are involved in d<sub>NN</sub> NOEs, which is inconsistent with
                    &#x3b2;-structure.</p>
                <p>We observed no long-range side chain-side chain NOEs despite increasing the
                    mixing time of the NOESY experiments up to 400 ms, perhaps due to residual
                    dynamics in the peptide. The lack of these distance restraints prevented the
                    generation of a well-converged solution structure; however, in support of the CD
                    and FTIR spectroscopic data, the NMR data are consistent with &#x3b1;-sheet
                    secondary structure and inconsistent with &#x3b1;-helix, random coil, and
                    &#x3b2;-sheet structures.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>Ten years ago a common conformation was demonstrated among soluble oligomeric
                    species from amyloid proteins/peptides of diverse sequence and structures that
                    cross react with the A11 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kayed et
                        al., 2003</xref>). Also at that time we identified a novel target structure,
                    &#x3b1;-sheet, through MD simulations and proposed that it is the defining
                    feature of the toxic oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armen
                        et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daggett,
                    2006</xref>). Unfortunately, the precise structure of this toxic intermediate
                    remains elusive, and it has become clear that the oligomers are conformationally
                    heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carulla et al., 2009</xref>;
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bitan et al., 2005</xref>, and references
                    therein). Here we have taken a different approach to probe these soluble
                    oligomeric species through experimental test of our &#x3b1;-sheet hypothesis
                    through peptides designed to be complementary to the proposed &#x3b1;-sheet
                    structure in the oligomeric intermediates. Three of these computationally
                    derived designs were synthesized and characterized experimentally, and they do
                    indeed appear to adopt &#x3b1;-sheet structure (as shown by FTIR, CD and NMR).
                    The two soluble &#x3b1;-sheet designs (<italic>&#x3b1;1</italic> and
                        <italic>&#x3b1;3</italic>) inhibited both TTR and A&#x3b2; aggregation in
                    solution. In addition, when immobilized to agarose beads, all three
                    &#x3b1;-sheet designs bound species from the toxic TTR and A&#x3b2; preparations
                    preferentially over the nontoxic fresh samples. In contrast, the
                        <italic>&#x3b2;</italic> control formed a &#x3b2;-hairpin, as supported by
                    CD and FTIR, and it preferentially bound the monomeric form of A&#x3b2; and it
                    did not react with TTR. When mature fibrils were applied to the immobilized
                    &#x3b1;&#x2212;sheet designs, the fibrils did not bind and appeared to have no
                    affinity for the &#x3b1;-sheet structure.</p>
                <p>While these &#x3b1;-sheet peptides were not designed against a specific protein
                    target, we observed inhibition of aggregation in two very different amyloid
                    systems. These results support our hypothesis that &#x3b1;-sheet structure is

                    reference to determine spectroscopic signatures that can now be used to
                    investigate the structural changes amyloid proteins undergo during amyloidosis.
                    In addition, the &#x3b1;-sheet designs may aid in capture of the elusive toxic
                    oligomeric species for in-depth characterization. Having demonstrated that the
                    &#x3b1;-sheet structure may constitute a broad-based inhibitor of amyloidosis,
                    our &#x3b1;-sheet designs introduce a novel class of amyloid inhibitors that

                <p>eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of
                    the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited
                    version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating
                    the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown.
                    Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent
                    (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

                        process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only
                    responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sending your work entitled &#x201c;Designed &#x03B1;-sheet peptides
                inhibit amyloid formation by targeting toxic oligomers&#x201d; for consideration at
                    <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior
                editor, John Kuriyan, and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of
                Reviewing Editors.</p>
            <p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we
                reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments
                to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
            <p>All reviewers agreed that your findings that peptides with a designed &#x03B1;-sheet
                conformation are capable of inhibiting amyloid formation by targeting toxic
                oligomers is a very important step towards characterizing the structural nature of
                pre-fibrillar, oligomeric states of proteins. All reviewers recommend publication
                after addressing some concerns that are summarized below:</p>
            <p>Some concerns raised focus on the behaviour of the designed peptides.</p>
            <p>1) Why don&#x27;t the &#x03B1;-sheet peptides oligomerize themselves instead of
                binding to the sequence diverse targets, in particular at 20:1 design/target
                concentration ratios?</p>
            <p>2) What is the net charge of designed peptides vs the net charge of the target? Can
                it be ruled out that the inhibition is not simply by electrostatic coating of the
                growing fibrils?</p>
            <p>3) Is the predicted burial of the solvent accessible surface area smaller for
                &#x03B1; sheets, thus allowing the use of urea to bias away from competing
                &#x03B2;-sheet structure?</p>
            <p>Other concerns focused on the interaction of the designed peptides with the
                oligomers.</p>
            <p>4). The binding of TTR to the
                    <italic>rc</italic> and the &#x03B2; peptides is explained by the background
                binding to the column material. However, the elution profile of the control
                experiment shown in  looks different. These differences in profiles should be
                explained.</p>
            <p>5). It seems that incubation with
                the <italic>rc</italic> peptide leads to a significant decrease in the aggregation
                of A&#x03B2; peptide. How can this be explained? The figure legend should be
                extended to better describe these results.</p>
            <p>Finally, concerns were raised regarding the NMR characterization of the
                &#x03B1;-sheet peptides</p>
            <p>6) The NMR data show that the peptides do not adopt an &#x03B1;-helical fold since
                typical sequential NOEs are missing. However, seems to indicate that the sequential alpha-amide NOE is stronger than
                the intraresidual one, which is expected for &#x03B2;-sheets. &#x03B2;-sheets can
                also have weak amide proton &#x2013; amide proton NOEs. The authors should compare
                the experimental NOE intensities to those calculated from the simulations, in a
                population-weighted sense. Since they have the trajectories already, this should be
                possible with relatively little additional work. They should also compare the
                expected NOE patterns derived from the simulations of &#x03B1;-sheets and
                &#x03B2;-sheets and provide a table with the expected distances in &#x03B1;-sheets
                &#x03B2;-sheets.</p>
            <p>7) In addition, the assignments seem to include some inconsistencies. For example, in
                    , bottom panel, the cross-peaks
                of 17/18 and 18/19 (which ought to be labeled 19/18) do not line up along the
                vertical dimension. This could possibly indicate that there is some heterogeneity in
                the peptide conformations. Similarly, several other cross-peaks have
                &#x27;shoulders&#x27;. Is there any evidence for some heterogeneity or can this be
                explained differently?</p>

            <p><italic>Some concerns raised focus on the behaviour of the designed
                peptides</italic>.</p>
            <p><italic>1) Why don&#x27;t the</italic> &#x03B1;<italic>-sheet peptides oligomerize
                    themselves instead of binding to the sequence diverse targets, in particular at
                    20:1 design/target concentration ratios?</italic></p>
            <p>Our peptides designs are highly polar and somewhat amphipathic, with one completely
                polar face and the other mixed polar/nonpolar. They were designed to prevent
                self-oligomerization and we were successful. The alpha-sheet designs presented here
                do not form oligomers even at the very high concentrations used for the NMR studies.
                There is enough hydrophobic surface on the designs, to allow for binding to more
                hydrophobic amyloidogenic species, however. While not described here, we have some
                newer designs that are more hydrophobic and they do aggregate and some form fibrils.
                But, our goal is soluble non-aggregating designs, as presented here.</p>
            <p>
                <italic>2) What is the net charge of designed peptides vs the net charge of the
                    target? Can it be ruled out that the inhibition is not simply by electrostatic
                    coating of the growing fibrils?</italic>
            </p>
            <p>If electrostatic coating were the mechanism by which our designs inhibited
                aggregation we would expect &#x03B1;<italic>3</italic> (net charge &#x2b;2) to be a
                better inhibitor than &#x03B1;<italic>1</italic> (&#x2b;1), and it is not.
                Similarly, <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> (&#x2b;2) does not inhibit TTR aggregation and
                    <italic>rc</italic> (&#x2b;1) doesn&#x2019;t inhibit aggregation in either
                system, despite having the same charges as &#x03B1;<italic>3</italic> and
                    &#x03B1;<italic>1,</italic> respectively. We also show that structure determines
                inhibition and that inhibition occurs during the aggregation process. These results
                are not consistent with a nonspecific electrostatic coating mechanism.</p>
            <p>
                <italic>3) Is the predicted burial of the solvent accessible surface area smaller
                    for &#x03B1; sheets, thus allowing the use of urea to bias away from competing
                    &#x03B2; sheet structure?</italic>
            </p>
            <p><italic>Other concerns focused on the interaction of the designed peptides with the
                    oligomers</italic>.</p>
            <p>We do not anticipate any appreciable difference in solvent-accessible surface area
                between &#x03B1;-sheet peptides and &#x03B2;-sheets. We have demonstrated that the
                crankshaft motion to switch from &#x03B1;- to &#x03B2;-sheet can occur with little
                change in side-chain orientation(Armen et al. 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib18">Daggett 2006</xref>), and therefore little change in SASA. Our
                design criteria were specifically chosen to prevent such complications by
                incorporating alternating D- and L-amino acid motifs. We are unsure what the
                reviewer means by using urea to bias away from competing &#x03B2;-sheet structure;
                we don&#x2019;t perform any experiments with urea.</p>

               <italic>Figure 3A and B</italic><italic>. The
                    binding of TTR to the</italic> rc <italic>and the &#x03B2; peptides is explained
                    by the background binding to the column material. However, the elution profile
                    of the control experiment shown in</italic>
                <italic>Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement
                        2</italic>
                <italic>looks different. These differences in profiles should be
                explained</italic>.</p>
            <p>The elution profile in the control experiment does look different because the matrix
                is different. <italic>rc</italic> and <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> both have peptide
                immobilized on the agarose, whereas the &#x201c;blank&#x201d; experiment is agarose
                blocked with tris. The blank surface is therefore very hydrophilic when compared to
                a surface coated with the peptides. It is unsurprising that TTR appears to elute
                more quickly from the polar blank column than it does from either column with
                immobilized peptides containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, as TTR is
                known to increase in hydrophobicity during aggregation, and therefore is expected to
                be retained longer under these conditions. We have added a short discussion of this
                in the legend to.</p>

                <italic>Figure 2C</italic><italic>. It seems
                    that incubation with the</italic> rc <italic>peptide leads to a significant
                    decrease in the aggregation of A&#x03B2; peptide. How can this be explained? The

                    &#x03B1;-sheet peptides</italic>
            </p>
            <p>The decrease in ThT fluorescence observed for the rc peptide is not necessarily a
                decrease in the amount of amyloid formed. Many other research groups have observed
                this phenomenon previously. For example, Anh and co-workers suggested that in their
                &#x03B1;-synuclein and A&#x03B2; experiments that the decrease in signal may be a
                result of unbound ThT quenching the binding fluorescence (Ahn et al. 2007). A
                similar observation was also reported by another group working on A&#x03B2; (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamin et al. 2009</xref>). There also appears to be
                a concentration dependence of this observation (Ahn et al. 2007), which could
                explain why we see a larger decrease in fluorescence for uninhibited A&#x03B2; (rc
                sample) than we do for our inhibited samples. This information has been added to the
                legend of.</p>
            <p><italic>6) The NMR data show that the peptides do not adopt an</italic>
                    &#x03B1;<italic>-helical fold since typical sequential NOEs are missing.
                    However,</italic>
                <italic>Figure 4</italic>
                <italic>seems to indicate that the sequential alpha-amide NOE is stronger than the
                    intraresidual one, which is expected for &#x03B2;-sheets. &#x03B2;-sheets can
                    also have weak amide proton &#x2013; amide proton NOEs. The authors should
                    compare the experimental NOE intensities to those calculated from the
                    simulations, in a population-weighted sense. Since they have the trajectories
                    already, this should be possible with relatively little additional work. They
                    should also compare the expected NOE patterns derived from the simulations
                    of</italic> &#x03B1;<italic>-sheets and &#x03B2;-sheets and provide a table with
                    the expected distances in</italic> &#x03B1;<italic>-sheets
                    &#x03B2;-sheets</italic>.</p>
            <p>To address this point the 1/r<sup>6</sup> values were calculated for NH-NH pairs over
                the MD-generated ensembles, which should be proportional to the NOE intensity, and
                they are reported in distances as requested in a new figure.
                    &#x03B1;<italic>1</italic> simulations were started from an &#x03B1;-sheet
                conformation and also from a &#x03B2;-sheet conformation, and presented as the
                average of triplicate 20 ns simulations at 298 K. We compared these results to MD of
                an antiparallel &#x03B2;-hairpin within a protein (PDB:1QAU). We found that in
                general the calculated intensities were stronger in the highlighted sheet regions in
                the alpha-sheet conformation, which is supportive of an &#x03B1;-sheet conformation
                rather than a &#x03B2;-sheet conformation. The tabulated data have been entered as

                <italic>7) In addition, the assignments seem to include some inconsistencies. For
                    example, in</italic><italic>Figure 4C</italic>
                
                <italic>, bottom panel, the cross-peaks of 17/18 and 18/19 (which ought to be
                    labeled 19/18) do not line up along the vertical dimension. This could possibly
                    indicate that there is some heterogeneity in the peptide conformations.
                    Similarly, several other cross-peaks have &#x27;shoulders&#x27;. Is there any
                    evidence for some heterogeneity or can this be explained differently?</italic>
            </p>
            <p>We assigned the major conformation observed from the NMR for this work. There does
                appear to be some alternate, less populated conformations, but assignment was not
                possible. This is unsurprising for a small hairpin peptide lacking disulfide bonds
                or other covalent restraints. The flipped labeling of the crosspeak was corrected in
