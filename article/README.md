Lens Article
=====

The Lens Article Format is an implementation the [Substance Document Model](http://github.com/substance/document) dedicated to scientific content. It features basic content types such as paragraphs, headings, and various figure types such as images, tables and videos complete with captions and cross-references.

The document defintions can be extended easily, so you can either create your own flavour or contribute to the Lens Article Format directly.

## Why creating another spec for scientific documents?

- XML-based formats such as NML are hard to consume by webclients
- Strict separation of content and style. Existing formats target print, and thus contain style information, which makes them hard to process by computer programs
- The greatest advantage of Lens Articles is that any of them can be viewed in [Lens](http://github.com/elifesciences/lens), a modern web-based interface for consuming science content.
